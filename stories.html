			<h4>Jewish male</h4>
			
			<p>I was hiding for several years. A kind family had let me hide in their house, along with my family. There I stayed 
				for about two years. I was taken in at the age of 30 with my family. I was separated from them and taken to Dachau
				concentration camp near the end of the war. The war ended soon, and my time in the concentration camp was ended
				relatively quickly compared to some of the other inmates. However, I will never forget the experience. It introduced 
				to me the unimaginable cruelty that human beings are capable of during their time on earth. The things that some
				people are willing to do to other people are so utterly horrible that no words can truly describe them. Dachau
				scarred my life.

			<h4>German female</h4>
			
			<p>I was taken in for hiding Jews in my attic. One of the Jews and I were taken to a concentration camp in Poland.
				It was absolutely horrible. The Nazies simply hated Jews and anyone else they didn't think worthy. They hated us
				so much that they the things that they were willing to do to us were simply beyond comprehension of how human
				beings could be so uncompassionate for other human beings. But that was the problem: they did not think of us as
				human beings. To us, we were not worthy to live and our mere existance was morally wrong.</p>
			
			<h4>Anonymous Jew</h4>
			
			<p>I was not actually taken to a death camp, but we were strongly persecuted in the streets. People would turn us
				down from jobs, kick us out of stores, and treat us as second class citizens. The Nazis installed a hatred of
				us and an atmosphere that we were inferior simply because of our race. Racism, I believe, was one of Hitler's
				biggest crimes; because of the unspeakable things it convinced him do to us.</p>
