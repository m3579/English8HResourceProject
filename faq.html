			<h4>How many people were killed during the Holocaust?</h4>
			
			<p>Most estimates put the death toll for Jews during the Holocaust around 6 million. The country where
				the most Jews were killed was Poland, with around 3 million Jews killed, and the country with the
				fewest Jews killed (except for Bulgaria, where no Jews were killed) was Finland, where 7 Jews were
				killed. Around 1.5 million children were killed: 1.2 million Jews and the remaining were other targets
				of the Holocaust. (Sources: "The History Place - Holocaust Timeline: Statistics of the Holocaust.",
									"The Holocaust.")

			<h4>What would it have been like to be a Jew during the Holocaust?</h4>
			
			<p>If you were a Jew during the time of the Nazi's Final Solution, then you would first be mistreated in
				public. The Nazi occupation in countries installed an anti-Jew atmosphere that promoted racism or
				acts of violence against Jews. Eventually, you may find yourself in hiding. A Good Samaritan might take
				you into their home, where you would hide from the Gestapo. Being in hiding was a risk to yourself and
				the person hiding you, but it was one you had to take. If you weren't in hiding, or if you had been
				caught, then you would have been taken to a concentration camp. At the concentration camps, the conditions
				were beyond most people's nightmares. The Nazi's did not think of the Jews as actual human beings, and
				they literally treated them as animals. They believed that Jews were deserving of torture and punishment
				just for their very existance. You would not be provided basic human needs, because they did not care for
				your well being at all. The concentration camps were literally one of the worst places to be in history. If
				you were fortunate enough to survive, then after the war you would probably go to a displaced person camp
				where you would recover from this horrific experience.</p>
				
			<h4>Why did the Nazis want to kill off all of the Jews?</h4>
			
			<p>The Nazi's believed that Germans were better than Jews and the other targets of the Holocaust.
			    Jews were near the bottom of their heirarchy of most superior races. Their racism prompted them to kill off people
			    who they had thought were inferior to them in order to to protect the superiority of Germany.</p>
