			<h4>General Information:</h4>
			
			<p>The Holocaust was known in Nazi Germany as the Final Solution. As part of the Final Solution, the Germans would kill
			any people who they thought were lesser than them. They mainly targeted Jews, although mentally ill people were killed
            as well. The Germans tried to separate the Jews from the rest of society and sent them to concentration camps to be
            tortured  in large numbers. Although Germany almost succedded, the Allies won World War II and the surviving Jews went to
            displaced person camps. (Source: "Introduction to the Holocaust.")</p>
