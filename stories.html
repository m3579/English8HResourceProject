			<h4>Jewish male</h4>
			
			<p>I was hiding for several years. A kind family had let me hide in their house, along with my own family. I stayed there 
				for about two years. The Gestapo caught us when I was thirty. I was separated from my family and taken to the Dachau
				concentration camp near the end of the war. The war ended soon, and my time in the concentration camp was ended
				quickly compared to some of the other inmates. However, I will never forget the experience. It showed 
				me the unimaginable cruelty that human beings are capable of doing. The things that some
				people are willing to do to other people are so utterly horrible that no words can truly describe them. Dachau
				scarred my life.

			<h4>German female</h4>
			
			<p>I was taken in for hiding Jews in my attic. They separated me from the rest of my family except for one Jew; we 
				were taken to a concentration camp in Poland.
				It was absolutely horrible. The Nazies simply hated Jews and anyone else they didn't think worthy. We were all treated
				horribly. They hated us so much that the things that they were willing to do to us were simply
				beyond comprehension of how human beings could be so uncompassionate for other human beings. But that was the
				problem: they did not think of Jews as human beings. To them, they were not worthy to live and their mere existance was
				morally wrong. To say that we (Jews and Gentiles who they thought were unworthy) were expected to be servile is a gross understatement; we were expected to
				die.</p>
			
			<h4>Anonymous Jew</h4>
			
			<p>I was not actually taken to a death camp, but we Jews were strongly persecuted in the streets. People would turn us
				out from jobs, kick us out of stores, and treat us with racism. The Nazis installed a hatred of
				us and an atmosphere that we were inferior simply because of our race. The kinder neighbors were churlish towards us;
				the harsher ones were aggressive. Racism, I believe, was one of Hitler's biggest crimes; because of the unspeakable
				things it pushed him to do to us.</p>
