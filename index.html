			<p><i>The Holocaust was an incredibly traumatic experience for many Jews. I sat down with
			a Holocaust survivor to ask a few questions:</i></p>
			
			<p class="question">Hello. I'm just going to ask you a few quick questions. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?</p>
			
			<p class="answer">I was a Polish Jew, about 23 at the time. I was taken to a concentration camp
				for about three years, before the Allies came back and freed us. I found my mother and father
				about a year later, and I have still not found my two brothers and one sister.</p>
	
			<p class="question">Do you think they are still alive?</p>
			
			<p class="answer">I do not believe they are. It is a hard fact, but it is unlikely that they are
				still with us.</p>
	
			<p class="question">So what was your experience like?</p>
			
			<p class="answer">I was taken from my home when I was in my early twenties. I was carried onto a bus,
				and they took us to a very large camp. The camp was filled with...broken...people carrying bricks
				and starving to death. German soldiers would stand over us and punish us for not doing our jobs, though
				our bodies simply could not do them anymore. It was worse for the sick and elderly; the care for them
				was horrid. People would die everyday before your eyes, and it was miserable to watch the
				cruelty before our eyes.</p>
	
			<p class="question">How did you make it through? What kept you going?</p>
	
			<p class="answer">For one thing, I kept a strong consience. The suffering can deteriorate your
				consience until you simply cannot handle it anymore. Horrible things were happening to people, and it takes
				a toll on your mental state. You need to be strong willed to survive one of the camps. I also focused on my family.
				I had convinced myself that some day, the war would be over; and I would see my family again. Although my
				sister and brothers are not with us, I am incredibly grateful that my parents survived.</p>
				
			<p class="question">And you certainly did keep a strong conscience. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
